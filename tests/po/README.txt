Note: The provided pl_PL.po is a Wordpress PO file. Wordpress is GPL, Pompon is not.
We're only passing this file for demonstration purposes. Feel free to use any other,
Pompon SHOULD be just as compatible with any other PO file as long as it's largely
well formatted.

It's not that we don't respect GPL, we just don't agree with the implications of the 
virality clauses.
